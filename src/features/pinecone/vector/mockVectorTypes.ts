An approved industry code of practice is a practical guide to achieving the standard of health and safety required by the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1983 and Regulations for a particular area of work. An approved industry code of practice should be followed, unless there is an alternative course of action which achieves the same or a better standard of health and safety in the workplace. An industry code of practice is approved by the Minister for Industrial Relations and Employment. It comes into effect on the day the notice of this approval is published in the NSW Government Gazette or on the day specified in the Gazette notice. An approved industry code of practice is designed to be used in conjunction with the Act and Regulations but does not have the same legal force. A person or company cannot be prosecuted for failing to comply with an approved industry code of practice. However, in proceedings, under the Act or Regulations, failure to observe a relevant approved industry code of practice can be used as evidence that a person or company has contravened or failed to comply with the provisions of the Act or Regulations. A WorkCover Authority inspector may cite an approved industry code of practice in a direction in an Improvement or Prohibition Notice, indicating the measures that should be taken to remedy an alleged contravention or non-compliance. Failure to comply with a requirement in an Improvement or Prohibition Notice is an offence.',

The supplier should provide a layer of 200mm x 200mm x 6.3mm welded steel mesh or equivalent to strengthen planked decks against shear failure from impact loads. WorkCover, the local council or other authorities may require a IOkPa live load for certain work and locations. 3.2 Wind loads Determine wind loads in accordance with AS1170.2-1989 Wind Loads, considering conditions prevailing after demolition if the permanent structure is to be demolished. Wind load calculations are to consider site sheds, equipment and materials which are expected to be supported by the overhead protective structure and adversely affect the stability of the overhead protective structure. 3.3 Superimposed loads Superimposed loads from site sheds and materials are not to exceed 40 per cent of the design live loads. 3.4 Stability Design the overhead protective structure for the effect of lateral loads including wind load and a horizontal load equivalent to at least 2.5 per cent of the vertical dead loads applied at the deck level. The structure is to be designed as a free standing structure in all cases except where it can be shown that adequate support is obtained from adjacent permanent structures which will remain for the duration of the overhead protective structure. Do not connect the overhead protective structure to a temporary facade supporting structure. Both structures should be independent, unless designed as a dual purpose structure. The structure should have a factor of safety of 1.5 against overturning and 2 against sliding. 3.5 Foundation a. Design the footings of the structure so as not to damage or have an adverse effect on any underground services and to be acceptable to the local council. b. Overhead protective structures affected by adverse foundation conditions require special design in accordance with the appropriate Australian Standards. 3.6 Vehicle impact The deck of an overhead protective structure should be designed so that it will not collapse when the superimposed load on the deck is equivalent to 40 per cent of its rated load with the removal of: a. any one column anywhere in the structure. b. a minimum length of 2 metres of wall supporting the deck on any side of the structure. Provision should be made for a suitable system of buffer railing or barrier kerb or a combination of both to minimise the effect of any vehicular impact on main load-bearing members, particularly at a location of greater risk such as at an intersection or on the outside of a sharp bend. 3.7 Dimensional requirements The following dimensions are considered necessary for safe access: a. A minimum clear distance of 250mm from the edge of the kerb to any part of the structure or any part attached to it. If this distance is greater than 400mm, pedestrian access between the structure and the kerb is to be blocked off at each end. b. A minimum overhead clearance of 2.2 metres to any bracings, beams or any other part of the structure. c. The street side should be open for at least two-thirds of its height for the full length of the structure to prevent a “tunnel effect”. 3.8 Waterproofing of deck Where pedestrians have access under the overhead protective structure, the deck is to be made waterproof. The decking should have a fall of at least 2 degrees to the horizontal to channel the run-off water to the work site. (See Clause 6.1 of this code).',
