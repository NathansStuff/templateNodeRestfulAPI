 Passage: And so I wanted to make sure that I shared that with the investor community as well, because that is what we're primarily managing to now.\n\n\nElon Musk:\n\nYes.\n\nSomething that I think some of these smart retail investors understand, but I think a lot of others maybe don't is that the -- every time we sell a car, it has the ability, just from uploading software to have full self-driving enabled and full self-driving is obviously getting better very rapidly.\n\nSo that's actually a tremendous upside potential because all of those cars, with a few exceptions -- I mean, only a small percentage of cars don't have Hardware 3.\n\nSo that means that there's millions of cars were full self-driving can be sold at essentially 100% gross margin.\n\nAnd the value of it grows as the autonomous capability grows.\n\nAnd then when it becomes fully autonomous, that is a value increase in the fleet.\n\nThat might be the biggest asset value increase of anything in history.\n\nYeah.\n\n\nMartin Viecha: Thank you.\n\nLet's go to the next investor question.\n\nSince Elon started political influencing, polls from Morning Consult and YouGov show…\nElon Musk: YouGov, crush that with your left.\n\n\nMartin Viecha: …show Tesla brand favorability declining in 2022 and division among partisan lines.\n\nSuch brand damage can impact demand.\n\nDoes Tesla track favorability?\n\nAnd how will any brand image be mitigated?\n\n\nElon Musk:\n\nWell, let me check my Twitter account.\n\nOkay, so I've got 127 million followers.\n[END OF DOCUMENT]\n\n
